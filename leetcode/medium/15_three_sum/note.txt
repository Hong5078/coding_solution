D1:
    Duplicate Case Handle 1:
    In the for loop, if the current number is the same as the previous number, 
    skip the iteration until a different number appears.

D2:
    Duplicate Case Handle 2:
    To prevent duplicate triplets, skip repeated values for either j or k 
    until a different number appears. 
    You only need to handle either j or k, not both.

    while nums[j] == nums[j - 1] and j < k:
        j += 1  # Skip duplicate values for j

    while j < k and nums[k] == nums[k + 1]:
        k -= 1  # Skip duplicate values for k
